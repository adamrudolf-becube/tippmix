# TippMix

An old code added to GitHub years later it was written. Code was written in 2014. Sorry for not including any instructions or descriptions, the purpose of this repo is to save the code to the future in a presentable way. As I remember I used Visual Studio to develop it.

Tippmix is a sport betting game in Hungary. This is a project which goes to the webpage (at the time it was written) and reads historical data via regular expressions. It tries to calculate the winning probabilities and mixes a low risk portfolio based on simple portfolio optimization models and risk measures.

The purpose of the project was for me to learn C#, try some of my financial knoledge I learnt that time at university and to try unit testing and test driven development in C#.

More detailed description in Hungarian is available on demand.
